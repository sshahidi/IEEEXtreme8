IEEEXtreme8
===========

These are the codes I did for the IEEEXtreme 8 online computer programming challenge:
http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/students/competitions/xtreme/index.html

There were more than 2000 teams attending the event.

The codes were all written in 24 consequtive hours (18-19 october 2014), each trying to solve of the problems of the competition.
I am not sure if I am allowed to upload the problems. I will do so if I find out it is OK.
